The first versions were for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_OS\">PalmOS</a> and developed using <a href=\"https://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/\">PRC Tools</a> on Linux. The server software was written in Java.

        "The initial project on PalmOS was probably the most challenging. The PalmOS PDB file format was simply sequential records of up to 64k each. There was no HTML component for rendering hypertext content for the data. To work around these limitations, I developed a binary hypertext format and used a slightly modified version of <a href=\"https://www.zlib.net/\">zlib</a> to compress multiple documents into a single PDB record. I also developed a downloader application in Java to keep the database files up to date and sync them to the device. Also during this project, I contributed a patch to the Linux kernel USB driver to recognize the device ID of the memory stick reader in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLI%C3%89\">Sony Clié</a>. After PalmOS, the platforms got subsequently easier to develop for as they provided built-in APIs for things like HTTP requests and HTML rendering.",
        "In 2007, when Apple launched the iPhone, we set about porting the application so we could have it on the App Store as soon as possible. We later added dedicated iPad support. This platform was yet easier to implement on due to a more advanced OS and built-in WebKit HTML and JavaScript engine and <a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org\">SQLite</a> database format. Android and Blackberry followed also using SQLite.",
